        # math solution
        # Meaning the I-th bulb that is on only on when its on I**2 turn, for example if you want 2 bulb on then you will have to go to             4th round, 3 bulb on -> 9th round. so for (n-th round) you can get at most floor(square_root(n)) bulb.
        return int(n**0.5)
